1.12. What is 2^(2^(2006))(mod 3)?

solution:
Short ans: 1

Think of a sequence of numbers where the ith term (element) is 2^2^i as i goes from 1 to 2006: 
2^2^1 = 4, 
2^2^2 = 16, 
2^2^3 = 256, 
etc. 

(2) Claim: the i+1th term is equal to the square of the ith term: 
2^2^(i+1) = 2^(2^i * 2) = 2^(2^i + 2^i) = (2^2^i)*(2^2^i) = (2^2^i)^2 
QED 


Notice in our enumeration above that the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd terms of the sequence are all equal to 1 mod 3. 

So, if we can prove that every term of this sequence = 1 mod 3, then we have shown that 2^2^2006 mod 3 is also 1. 

Let x be one of the terms of the sequence. 

(3) If x mod 3 = 1, then what can we say about x^2 mod 3 (x^2 being the next term in the sequence because of (2))? 

By (3), there is an integer k such that x = 3k + 1; 

(4) Then x^2 = (3k + 1)^2 = 9k^2 + 6k + 1 

Inspecting the right side of (4), we see that it is divisible by 3 with a remainder of 1, 

therefore we have shown that, if the ith term = 1 mod 3, that implies the i+1th term is also 1 mod 3. 

Since we have shown that the 1st term of the sequence = 1 mod 3; and that assuming thats true of the ith 
term implies its also true for the i+1th term, 
then, BY INDUCTION, its true for EVERY term of the sequence 2^2^i ; 

In particular its true for the 2006th term, 

so: 2^2^2006 mod 3 = 1
