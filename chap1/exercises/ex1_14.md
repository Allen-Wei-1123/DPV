1.14. Suppose you want to compute the nth Fibonacci number F(n) , modulo an integer p. Can you find
an efficient way to do this? (Hint: Recall Exercise 0.4.)

solution:
Lets say running time of multiplying n-bit numbers is T(n)
fib3 from chapter 0 involves O(logn) operations (multiplication).
since we are taking mod p, each intermediate result would be log(p) bits long.
Therefore, total running time is: O(log(n)*T(log(p)))
