1.20. Find the inverse of: 20 mod 79, 3 mod 62, 21 mod 91, 5 mod 23.


Solution(s):

The inverse of a mod m exists if and only if gcd(a, m) = 1
PROOF:
======
Then there exists an integer x such that a*x == 1 mod m. 
Which means there exists an integer k such that a*x = 1 + k*m, which I write as a*x - k*m = 1. 
Define d = gcd(a,m). 
Then d divides a and d divides m, so d must divide also a*x and k*m, and also a*x - k*m. 
But a*x - k*m is 1, so d must divide 1. And since d > 0, the only possibility is d = 1. 
This is a contradiction: by assumption, d > 1.

a. 20 mod 79
gcd(20, 79) = 1, so the inverse EXISTS and its 4.

To calculate: X^(-1) mod N
Enter X: 20
Enter N: 79
Ans:  4

b. 3 mod 62
gcd(3, 62) = 1, so the inverse Exists and its 21.
~/DPV/chap1$ python3 inverse_modulo.py 
To calculate: X^(-1) mod N
Enter X: 3
Enter N: 62
Ans:  21

c. 21 mod 91
gcd(21, 91) = 7, therefore the inverse DOES NOT Exists.

d. 5 mod 23
gcd(5, 23) = 1, so the inverse EXISTS and its 14.

Enter X: 5
Enter N: 23
Ans:  14
