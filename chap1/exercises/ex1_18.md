1.18. Compute gcd(210, 588) two different ways: by finding the factorization 
of each number, and by using Euclidâ€™s algorithm.

Solution:

Factorization Method:
210 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 
588 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 7 * 7 
gcd (210, 588) = 42 

Euclid Method:
gcd (210, 588) = gcd (168, 210) = gcd (42, 168) = gcd (1,42) = 42 
```
