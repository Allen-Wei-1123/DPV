1.3. A d-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has at most d children. Show that any d-ary
tree with n nodes must have a depth of Ω(log n/ log d). Can you give a precise formula for the
minimum depth it could possibly have?
solution:
a. Lets consider a balanced d-ary tree - meaning difference of height 
in left and right subtree is no more than 1
b. Each level in the tree has d times more nodes than the previous level.
c. Hence the number of vertices at level i is d^(i), that gives the number of nodes at depth h = d^h

Sum of nodes at each level gives a geometric series:
d. 1 + d + d^2 + d^3 + ... + d^h = (d^(h+1) - 1)/(d-1)
e. Now d^(h+1) = n*(d-1) + 1 // n is the total number of nodes in tree
f. From above d^(h+1) >= n+1
g. Taking log at both sides of f. we have: log(d^(h+1)) >= log(n+1)
h. (h+1)log(d) >= log(n)
i. from h. step we have now, h >= log(n)/log(d)
j. finally, h >= log(n) (base is d here) // this is the precise formula required for min depth h of the d-ary tree
k. from i. step we have, h = Ω(log(n)/log(d)) //proof for first part of the question.
