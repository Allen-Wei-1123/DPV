1.7. How long does the recursive multiplication algorithm (page 25) take to multiply an n-bit number
by an m-bit number? Justify your answer.
```
```py
function multiply(x, y)
# Input: Two n-bit integers x and y, where y â‰¥ 0
# Output: Their product
    if y = 0: return 0
    z = multiply(x, y/2) 
    if y is even:
        return 2*z
    else:
        return x + 2*z

```
```py
solution:
let x be the n bit number and y be the m-bit number
a. There are m recursive calls as y is halved in each call - division by 2 (right shift)
b. A test for add/even(looking at the last bit), a multiplication by 2 (left shift)
and one addition - a total of O(m) bit operations
c. Hence from a. and b. we have Total time complexity as: O(m^2)
```
