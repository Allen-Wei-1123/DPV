1.11. Is 4^1536 âˆ’ 9^4824 divisible by 35?

solution:
short ans: Yes

justification:
1) Fermat little theorem: for any integer a and prime number p, a^(p-1) mod p = 1;
2) Chinese remainder theorem: for any integer a, prime numbers p and q, if a mod p = x && a mod q = x, then a mod p*q = x;
--> a^(4x6) mod (5*7) = 1.
--> because both 4824 and 1536 are multiples of 24, so for any integer a and b, a^(24*n) - b^(24*m) is divisible by 35.
```
