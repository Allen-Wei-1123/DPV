1.21. How many integers modulo 11^3 have inverses? (Note: 11^3 = 1331.)


Solution:
A number n has inverse modulo 1331 if and only if gcd(n, 1331) = 1 ie it is relative prime to 1331
for gcd(n, 1331) != 1 then either n = 0 or shares some common factor with 1331 (11 * 11 * 11)
The numbers not relative prime to 1331 are multiples of 11 and there are 1331/11 = 121 of them.
Hence there are 1331-121 = 1210 number with inverses.
