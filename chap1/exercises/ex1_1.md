1.1. Show that in any base b â‰¥ 2, the sum of any three single-digit numbers is at most two digits long.
solution:
a. let x, y, z be the single digit numbers in base b.
b. Now x, y and z can be atmost (b-1). eg. in base 10 max single digit is 9.
c. lets call the 3 single digit sum as S, now S = x + y + z
d. S = x + y + z = (b-1) + (b-1) + (b-1) = 3*b - 3 = 3*(b-1)
e. for b = 2, S = 3*(2-1) = 3 = 11 which is atmost 2 digit long
f. for b >= 3, S = 3*(b-1) <= b*(b-1) < b^2
g. So, now S < b^2. and b^2 in any base S < b^2 can be represented in 2 digits.
