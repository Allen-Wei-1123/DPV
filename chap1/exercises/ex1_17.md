1.17. Consider the problem of computing x y for given integers x and y: we want the whole answer, not
modulo a third integer. We know two algorithms for doing this: the iterative algorithm which
performs y−1 multiplications by x; and the recursive algorithm based on the binary expansion
of y.
Compare the time requirements of these two algorithms, assuming that the time to multiply an
n-bit number by an m-bit number is O(mn).
```

```py
Solution:

x and y are n bits long. We are going to find the time complexity of 2 algorithms
for computing x^y.

FIRST ALGORITHM:
================
def iterative_exponentiation(x, y):
    """Input: x and y are n-bit long
    output: x^y """
    prod = x
    for i in range(1, y):
        prod *= x
    return prod

Complexity Analysis for iterative_exponentiation:
a. After each multiplication, the size of the product becomes i*n, where i is the current iteration.
b. Total time is 
y-1
∑ O((i*n)*n) = (y-1)*(y/2)*O(n^2) = O((y^2)*(n^2)) where y is O(2^n)
i=0


SECOND ALGORITHM:
=================
def recursive_exponentiation(x, y):
    """input: x and y each n-bit long
    output: x^y """
    if y == 0:
        return 1
    z = recursive_exponentiation(x, y//2)
    if y%2 == 0:
        return z*z
    else:
        return x*z*z

Complexity Analysis for recursive_exponentiation:
a. Since y is n-bit long, number of iterations is bounded by O(n)
b. Size of z on each return from recursive call increases by a factor of 4.
c. Total running time:
O(n^2) + O(4*n^2) + ... + O((2^(n-2)*n)^2) = O((n^2)*(2^(2*n)))
```
