1.17. Consider the problem of computing x y for given integers x and y: we want the whole answer, not
modulo a third integer. We know two algorithms for doing this: the iterative algorithm which
performs yâˆ’1 multiplications by x; and the recursive algorithm based on the binary expansion
of y.
Compare the time requirements of these two algorithms, assuming that the time to multiply an
n-bit number by an m-bit number is O(mn).
