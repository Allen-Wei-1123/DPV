1.8. Justify the correctness of the recursive division algorithm given in page 26, and show that it
takes time O(n^2) on n-bit inputs.

function divide(x, y)
# Input: Two n-bit integers x and y, where y ≥ 1
# Output: The quotient and remainder of x divided by y
if x = 0: return (q, r) = (0, 0)
(q, r) = divide( x/2 , y)
q = 2 · q, r = 2 · r
if x is odd: r = r + 1
if r ≥ y: r = r − y, q = q + 1
return (q, r)
