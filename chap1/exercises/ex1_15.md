1.15. Determine necessary and sufficient conditions on x and c so that the following holds: for any a, b,
if ax ≡ bx mod c, then a ≡ b mod c.

solution:
Statement : For any a, b, if ax ≡ bx mod c, then a ≡ b mod c.

Necessary and Sufficient Condition Derivation:
ax ≡ bx(modc) ⇒ c|(a − b)x // c divides (a-b)*x
a ≡ b(modc) ⇒ c|(a − b) // c divides (a-b)

Now since c must divide (a-b)x and c must divide (a-b), we should choose x
such that GCD(c,x) = 1 which will ensure that if (a-b)x is divisible by c, then

(a-b) must be divisible by c as GCD(c,x) is 1. //necessary and sufficient condition
