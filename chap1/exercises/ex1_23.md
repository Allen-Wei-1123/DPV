Show that if a has a multiplicative inverse modulo N , then this inverse is unique (modulo N ).

Solution:

Lets prove contradiction:

1. Suppose x and y are distinct inverses of a mod N.
2. Then, it implies:
x = x * 1 = x*a*y = (x*a)*y = 1 * y = y (mod N) <= which is a contradiction to statement 1.
