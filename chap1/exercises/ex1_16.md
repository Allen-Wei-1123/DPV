1.16. The algorithm for computing a^b(mod c) by repeated squaring does not necessarily lead to the
minimum number of multiplications. Give an example of b > 10 where the exponentiation can
be performed using fewer multiplications, by some other method.

Solution:
For example, 81 ^ 2412 (mod 35) 
First square modulo get 11^2412, and then take the cube, 
get 1331^804 (mod 35) => 1^804 (mod 35) 
```
