1.5. Unlike a decreasing geometric series, the sum of the harmonic series 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, . . . di-
verges; that is,

∞
∑(1/i) = ∞
i=1

It turns out that, for large n, the sum of the first n terms of this series can be well approximated as

n
∑(1/i) ≈ ln n + γ
i=1

where ln is natural logarithm (log base e = 2.718 . . .) and γ is a particular constant 0.57721 . . ..
Show that
n
∑(1/i) = Θ(log n)
i=1
(Hint: To show an upper bound, decrease each denominator to the next power of two. For a lower
bound, increase each denominator to the next power of 2.)

solution:

Upper Bound:
======================
a. 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 ... + 1/n <= 1 + (1/2 + 1/2) + (1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4) + ..

b. 
n
∑(1/i) <= 1 + (2/2) + (4/4) ...
i=1

c.
n
∑(1/i) <= log(n)
i=1


Lower Bound:
=====================
a. 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + ... + 1/n <= (1/2 + 1/2) + (1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4) + (1/8 + 1/8 ..) + ..

b.
n
∑(1/i) >= (2/2) + (4/4) + (8/8) ...
i=1

c.
n
∑(1/i) >= log(n)
i=1

From upper bound and lower bound we have,
n
∑(1/i) = Θ(log n)
i=1
