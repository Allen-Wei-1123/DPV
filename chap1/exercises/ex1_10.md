1.10. Show that if a ≡ b (mod N ) and if M divides N then a ≡ b (mod M ).

solution:
Give a ≡ b (mod N)
1. a = q1 * N + r1 //where q1 and r1 are quotient and remainder respectively.
2. b = q2 * N + r1 // where q2 and r1 are quotient and remainder respectively.
3. a = q1*N + (b - q2*N) = (q1-q2)*N + b 
4. a = b + (q1 - q2)*N
5. since M divides N, we can write N = M*x
6. from 4 & 5 we have, a = b + (q1 - q2)*M*x
7. a = b + (q1*x - q2*x)*M
8. a = b + (q3 - q4)*M // q3 = q1*x and q4 = q2*x
9. from 4 & 8 we have proved a ≡ b (mod M)
