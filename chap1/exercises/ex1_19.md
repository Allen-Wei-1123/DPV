1.19. The Fibonacci numbers F0 , F1 , . . . are given by the recurrence F(n+1) = F(n) + F(n−1) , F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1.

Solution:

In a nutshell we need to prove that 2 consecutive Fibonacci numbers are prime.

PROOF BY INDUCTION:
===================
Let F(i) be the ith Fibonacci number.

Base Case: 
F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1, so gcd(F(0), F(1)) = 1, so they are relatively prime.

Inductive Step:
Assuming that the consecutive Fibonacci numbers F(k) and F(k-1) are relative prime,
a. gcd(F(k), F(k-1)) = 1
We need to prove that F(k+1), F(k) are relatively prime.

gcd(F(k+1), F(k)) = gcd(F(k), remainder(F(k+1), F(k)))
                  = gcd(F(k), remainder(F(k) + F(k-1), F(k))) // b.
                  = gcd(F(k), F(k-1)) 
                  = 1 //from a. above
For the b. step, observe that F(k−1) < F(k), which implies that the remainder of F(k−1)
divided by F(k) is F(k−1). The last equality holds by the inductive hypothesis. Thus, F(k)
and F(k+1) are relatively prime, so our claim holds for n = k.
Therefore, the statement that consecutive Fibonacci numbers are relatively prime holds
for n ≥ 0.

=====================================================================
PROOF BY CONTRADICTION:
======================
An alternative approach for the inductive step is to use some
version of proof by contradiction or contrapositive. For example:
Suppose that F(k) and F(k+1) had some common factor d > 1. By the definition of the
Fibonacci numbers, F(k+1) = F(k) + F(k−1). So F(k−1) = F(k+1) − F(k). So, since d divides both
F(k) and F(k+1), it must also divide F(k−1). (See facts about divisibility on internet)

But this means that d is a common factor (> 1) of F(k) and F(k−1), so they cannot be
relatively prime, contradicting our inductive hypothesis.
Assuming a common factor for F(k) and F(k+1) led to a contradiction, so they must be
relatively prime.
