1.24. If p is prime, how many elements of {0, 1, . . . , p^n − 1} have an inverse modulo p^n ?

Solution:
From the set given 0,1,2,...,p^n -1 we have to exclude all numbers which are multiple of p since 
gcd(k*p, p^n ) where 0 ≤ k < p^(n−1) is surely not equal to 1 as p is a common divisor for both the numbers. 
Now lets consider numbers of the form k*p+i where 0<i<p-1. k and i are integers. Now gcd(kp+i,p n ) = 1 
as p is surely not a divisor of k*p+i and p is the only prime divisor of p^n . Therefore total numbers
in the set which are multiple of p are p^(n−1)
Numbers which have an inverse are p^n − p^(n−1)
