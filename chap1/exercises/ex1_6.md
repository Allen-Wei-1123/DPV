1.6. Prove that the grade-school multiplication algorithm (page 24), when applied to binary numbers,
always gives the right answer.

Solution:
when we multiply 2 numbers x & y, one way to look at it is we are performing y number of x additions

y = b (binary representation)
b = (b1*2^0) + (b2*2^1) + (b3*2^2) + ... + (bn*2^n) // where bi is bit value [0, 1]

Now multiplying number x is equivalent of shifting binary rep of x to left hand side by 1 position
example:
5 = 101
5 * 2 = 10 = 1010 //we also get this by shifting "101"(5) once to left, which gives us "1010"

now we take binary rep of x and get different values by shifting it to left corresponding to
the set bit values of y and their positions (number of shift to left depends on position of set bit value)
example:
let x = 10(decimal) = 1010 (binary)
y = 6 = 110

a. now first bit of y is "0" at position 0, so nothing to shift.
b. second bit is "1" at position 1 so we shift x by 1 which gives us => 10100 (call it x1)
c. third bit is "1" at position 2, so lets shift x by 2 to left => 101000 (call it x2)
d. add (x1 + x2) = 010100 + 101000 = 111100 = 60 (decimal result of 10 * 5)

but a. to d. are the same steps we get in grade school multiplication algorithm for binary numbers.

Conclusion:
=============
As we saw above there is equivalence to the grade school multiplication algorithm for binary numbers
and multiplying 2 binary numbers x & y using above approach. Hence we can say that the grade school 
multiplication algorithm will always give the right answer.
