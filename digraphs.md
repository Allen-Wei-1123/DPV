Digraphs
=================================================
To enter "special" characters such as the euro or copyright symbols, or diacritical marks such as the German umlaut or accent grave, digraphs can be used.

Digraphs work by pressing CTRL-K and a two-letter combination while in insert mode. For example, in insert mode type:
```py
CTRL-K a:
CTRL-K e>
to give ä and ê.
```
